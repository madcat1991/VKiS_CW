In The End
==========
`В кривом разбиении куплетов на абзацы прошу винить elyrics.net`

It starts with <br/>
One thing I don't know why <br/>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br/>
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme <br/>
To explain in due time 

All I know <br/>
Time is a valuable thing <br/>
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <br/>
Watch it count down to the end of the day <br/>
The clock ticks life away 

It's so unreal <br/>
Didn't look out below <br/>
Watch the time go right out the window <br/>
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know <br/>
Or wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside <br/>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart <br/>
What it meant to me will eventually be <br/>
A memory of a time when

**(Chorus:)**<br/>
I tried so hard and got so far <br/>
But in the end it doesn't even matter <br/>
I had to fall to lose it all <br/>
But in the end it doesn't even matter 

One thing, I don't know why <br/>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br/>
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme <br/>
To remind myself how 

I tried so hard <br/>
In spite of the way you were mocking me <br/>
Acting like I was part of your property <br/>
Remembering all the times you fought with me <br/>
I'm surprised it got so far

Things aren't the way they were before <br/>
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <br/>
Not that you knew me back then <br/>
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside <br/>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart <br/>
What it meant to me will eventually be <br/>
A memory of a time when

**(Chorus:)**<br/>
I tried so hard and got so far <br/>
But in the end it doesn't even matter <br/>
I had to fall to lose it all <br/>
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you <br/>
Pushed as far as I can go <br/>
And for all this <br/>
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you <br/>
Pushed as far as I can go <br/>
And for all this <br/>
There's only one thing you should know

**(Chorus:)**<br/>
I tried so hard and got so far <br/>
But in the end it doesn't even matter <br/>
I had to fall to lose it all <br/>
But in the end it doesn't even matter
