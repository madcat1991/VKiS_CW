Papercut
========
<br/>
Why does it feel like night today? <br/>
Something in here's not right today. <br/>
Why am I so uptight today? <br/>
Paranoia's all I got left <br/>
I don't know what stressed me first <br/>
Or how the pressure was fed <br/>
But I know just what it feels like <br/>
To have a voice in the back of my head <br/>
It's like a face that I hold inside <br/>
A face that awakes when I close my eyes <br/>
A face watches every time I lie <br/>
A face that laughs every time I fall <br/>
(And watches everything) <br/>
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim <br/>
That the face inside is hearing me <br/>
Right underneath my skin <br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back <br/>
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head <br/>
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within <br/>
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin <br/>
<br/>
I know I've got a face in me <br/>
Points out all my mistakes to me <br/>
You've got a face on the inside too and <br/>
Your paranoia's probably worse <br/>
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand <br/>
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is <br/>
I can't add up to what you can but <br/>
Everybody has a face that they hold inside <br/>
A face that awakes when I close my eyes <br/>
A face watches every time they lie <br/>
A face that laughs every time they fall <br/>
(And watches everything) <br/>
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim <br/>
That the face inside is watching you too <br/>
Right inside your skin <br/>
<br/>
Chorus <br/>
<br/>
The face inside is right beneath your skin (3x) <br/>
<br/>
The sun goes down <br/>
I feel the light betray me (Repeat until end) <br/>
<br/>
Chorus (Repeat until end)
