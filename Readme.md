High Voltage
============

`Хочу UTF-8, и точка!`
<br/>
<i><br/>
You know what I mean <br/>
You could put a label on a life, <br/>
Put a label on a lifestyle <br/>
</i><br/>
Sometimes...<br/>
<i><br/>
You know <br/>
Put a label on how you wake up every morning <br/>
And go to bed at night <br/>
</i><br/>
*Hybrid*

<br/>
I've been diggin into crates ever since I was livin in space <br/>
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits <br/>
I mastered numerology and big bang theology <br/>
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology <br/>
Invented the mic so I could start blessin it <br/>
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist <br/>
Many men have tried to shake us <br/>
But I twist mic cords in double helixes and show them what I'm made of <br/>
I buckle knees like leg braces <br/>
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness and all of you emcees who hate us <br/>
So you can try on, <br/>
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on <br/>
From now to infinity let icons be bygones <br/>
I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this <br/>
I tried threats but moved on to a promise <br/>
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice <br/>
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this <br/>


**Chorus:**
<br/>
<br/>
*High Voltage*<br/>
The unforgettable sound<br/>
*High Voltage*<br/>
Bringing you up and taking you down <br/>
*High Voltage*<br/>
Coming at you from every side <br/>
*High Voltage*<br/>
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide <br/>
<br/><br/>

Akira, I put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones <br/>
Never satisfy my rhyme jones <br/>
Sprayin bright day over what you might say <br/>
My Blood type's Krylon- Technicolor type A <br/>
On highways ride with road rage <br/>
Cages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around <br/>
*Surround sound*<br/>
Devouring the scene <br/>
Subliminal gangrene paintings <br/>
Over while the same thing<br/>
Sing song karaoke copy bullshit <br/>
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics <br/>
Fourth dimension, combat convention <br/>
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention <br/>
Meant to put you away with the pencil <br/>
Pistol, official, 16 line a rhyme missile <br/>
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws <br/>
Spin rah, blah blah blah, you can say you saw <br/>
<br/>
**Chorus (2x)**
<br/>
<br/>
<i><br/>
And like the rock and rap <br/>
You know what i mean <br/>
People act like you know <br/>
Wow that's a new invention <br/>
That shits ain't new <br/>
We're constantly evolving <br/>
It is constantly changing <br/>
</i><br/>
Sometimes...  <br/>
<i><br/>
There's a lot of change <br/>
Everybody's always up with labels <br/>
There ain't no label for this shit <br/>
They're always gonna try to put a label on it <br/>
Try to create something <br/>
So they can water it down <br/>
</i><br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel like a prophet <br/>
Misunderstood <br/>
Under the gun like a new disease <br/>
Sometimes I feel like a prophet <br/>
Misunderstood <br/>
Under the gun like a new disease <br/>
<br/>
**Chorus (4x)**
<br/>
<br/>
<i>You know what I mean, you can put a label on a lifestyle</i>
